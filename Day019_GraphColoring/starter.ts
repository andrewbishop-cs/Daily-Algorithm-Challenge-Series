/*
In this challenge, you are a software developer for a logistics company that manages supply chain 
operations across various cities. The company is trying to optimize its operations to reduce 
delivery time by guiding supply trucks through these interconnected cities.

To make it easier for the drivers, the company wants every two adjacent cities to have 
different colors so that the driver doesn't get confused. Here comes your challenge, you have 
to write a function 'validateCityAndColor' which takes a graph where each node in the graph 
represents a city and an object representing color assignments to each city. The function should 
return true if every two connected cities have different colors; otherwise false.

You can assume that each city is connected to at least one other city.

export function validateCityAndColor(graph: Map<string, string[]>, 
	colors: Map<string, string>): boolean {
	// TODO: implement code here

	return false
}
