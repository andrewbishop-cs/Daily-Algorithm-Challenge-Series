/*
You've been tasked with implementing an ad-blocker for a new web browser your
company is developing. The ad-blocker blocks specific URLs from being loaded on the
browser.

The list of blocked URLs is dynamic and can be updated at any time. To save processing
power, the browser must not check every single URL against the entire list of blocked URLs.

Instead, implement feature to efficiently determine if the browser should block a given
URL based on the current list of blocked URLs.

warmUp: Take a LeetCode problem related to Hashmaps: 'Two Sum' which is an easy problem.
Also, take up a medium difficulty problem related to hashmaps: 'Longest Substring Without
Repeating Characters'.

	return false;
