/*
As a tech lead, you are asked to automate the dependency installing process for your
project. Each dependency has a set of dependencies upon which it depends.
You decide to model the dependencies as a graph where each node represents a dependency.
Your task is to write a function 'getInstallationOrder' that, given the graph,
determines in what order to install the dependencies so that a dependency is installed
only after all its dependencies.

Function Signature: getInstallationOrder(dependencies: Map<string, string[]>): string[]

Input: a Map where keys are string representing a dependency and values are arrays
of strings representing the dependencies of the associated key.

Output: an array of strings representing the order in which to install the dependencies.
*/

export function getInstallationOrder(dependencies: Map<string, string[]>): string[] {
	// TODO: implement code here
	return []
}
