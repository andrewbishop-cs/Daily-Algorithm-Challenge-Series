As a software engineer at an online retail company, you are tasked with optimizing
the product combination on promotion banners. You are given an array of products,
where each product is a string name and an integer price and an integer target.
The banner can promote multiple products, but the total cost of the promoted products
should not exceed the target.
Write a function to return a 2-d array, which includes all combinations of products that
sum to the maximum value that is less or equal to the target while optimizing the count
of items.
Function Signature: multiProductOptimizer(products: Array<[string, number]>, target: number):
