/*
  At our company, we deal with a multitude of system logs that are produced by different parts
  of our application. These logs come in as separate events, and we want to design a filter to retrieve the
  most common event titles

  Example 1:
    Input: events = ["login","logout","login","purchase","login","purchase"], k = 2
    Output: ["login","purchase"]

  Example 2:
    Input: events = ["error"], k = 1
    Output: ["error"]
