/*
Imagine your role in managing a ticket validation service for a popular event management platform. 
Your task is to design a function, validateTickets to validate a batch of event tickets represented 
by their alphanumeric code (a string).
The rules are:

- A ticket is valid if and only if the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the odd 
index positions equals the sum of the ASCII values of the characters in the even index positions.
- The index of the first character of the ticket code is 1.

The function takes in a two-dimensional array where each array represents a batch of tickets to validate. Each 
batch of tickets could have different size.

Example:
Input: [['ABC', 'AEBFD', 'AGCBDE', 'BDA']] 

Here, 

'ABC'
The ASCII values are A=65, B=66, C=67. Odd positions sum=66, even positions sum=132. Ticket is invalid.

'AEBFD'
The ASCII values are A=65, E=69, B=66, F=70, D=68. Odd positions sum=135, even positions sum=134. Ticket is invalid.

'AGCBDE'
The ASCII values are A=65, G=71, C=67, B=66, D=68, E=69. Odd positions sum=201, even positions sum=200. 
Ticket is invalid. 

'BDA'
The ASCII values are B=66, D=68, A=65. Odd positions sum=133, even positions sum=66. Ticket is invalid.

Output: [[false, false, false, false]]

Your task is to implement the validateTickets function.
