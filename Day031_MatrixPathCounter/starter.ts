/*
 Your organization is developing a path planning algorithm for self-navigating drones.
 Every drone has a map given as a 2D grid (matrix) with integers, where each cell represents a sector
 that the drone can navigate.
 Cells with negative numbers represent restricted zones and positive numbers represent allowed sectors.
 To start, the drone is always in the top-left cell of the grid and wants to go to the bottom-right cell.
 The drone can move either to the right or down, not diagonally.
 
 Your task is to write an algorithm, matrixPathCounter(matrix), that will count the total number
 of allowed paths for the drone to reach its destination, avoiding restricted sectors.
 
 Constraints:
 - The matrix will have at least 1 row and at most 1000 rows, and at least 1 column and at
   most 1000 columns.
 - Cells will have an integer, with a positive number representing an allowed sector and a
   negative number a restricted one. Zero is neutral.
 
 LeetCode warm-ups:
 - Easy/Medium: Unique Paths (LC 62)
 - Medium/Hard: Paths With Maximum Score (LC 1301)
