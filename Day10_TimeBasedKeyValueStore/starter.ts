Problem Description:

You're working on the development of a new distributed system. The system needs a time-based
key-value store that supports two operations - set() and get(). The set operation should store
the key and value, along with a provided timestamp. The get operation should return the most
recent value for a given key up to a specified timestamp. If there are no values up to the
given timestamp, the get operation should return an empty string.

This is a problem about designing a data structure that can support set and get operations with
a time condition. Note that you may assume that the timestamps are strictly increasing, so you
don't need to handle situations where two or more set operations occur at the same timestamp.

Function Signature:

- For the set operation:
set(key: string, value: string, timestamp: number): void
- For the get operation:
get(key: string, timestamp: number): string
