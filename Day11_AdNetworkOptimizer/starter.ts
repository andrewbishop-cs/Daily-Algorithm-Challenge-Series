/**
  You work for a digital advertising company and they want to optimize their ad network performance,
  and they have tasked you with creating a solution. The company has an extensive network of ad-
  servers that each serve ads for different websites.

  Each server can communicate with some of the other servers and there is a cost associated with each
  communication. Some servers cannot communicate directly but they can do so indirectly if they share
  a common server they can communicate with.

  You need to find the minimum cost to reach all servers in the network. However, due to the high-
  volume and frequency of connections, the solution should be very optimized.

  The network can be modeled as a graph where each node represents an ad-server and an edge between
  two nodes represents a direct communication path. Your task is to implement a function, optimizeNetwork,
  that takes a graph g of n nodes and returns the minimum cost to reach all servers.

  The input graph g is represented as an adjacency matrix such that g[i][j] represents the cost of
  going from node i to node j. If g[i][j] is -1, this means node i cannot directly reach node j.
  The function should return the minimum total cost to reach all servers or -1 if it's not possible.
