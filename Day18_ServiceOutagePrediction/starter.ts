/*
 * Our company has a complex network of servers, all interconnected. Recently, we've had an
 * issue of cascaded failure, where if one server fails, it can cause a knock-on effect and take
 * down many others.
 *
 * To help with disaster recovery planning, you've been tasked with creating a function to
 * predict the impact of a single server failing.
 *
 * We model our network of servers as a graph, where every server is a node, and every connection
 * between servers is an edge. Each edge is given a 'weight' to reflect the impact level.
 *
 * The function you write should take the ID of a hypothetical failed server, then perform a
 * depth-first search (DFS) on the graph to find out which other servers would be affected if this
 * one failed, following the pattern of connectivity and impact levels, but stopping if it reaches
 * a node that is already in the failure list.
 *
 * Implementing an effective backtracking mechanism here could boost efficiency.
 *
 * Given an input of the server graph (as a matrix of weights, with -1 indicating no connection)
 * and an initial failed server ID, your function should output a list of failed servers
 * (including the initial one).
 *
 * You may assume that the server IDs are integers starting from 0 and the server graph is a
 * square matrix with a size equivalent to the total number of servers.
