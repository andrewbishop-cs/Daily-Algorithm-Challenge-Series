 * Warm up problems
 *  Leetcode 141 - Linked List Cycle
 *  Leetcode 142 - Linked List Cycle II
 * 
 * 
 * Given a mapping of configuration keys to lists of other keys they include,
 * determine whether any include chain forms a cycle (i.e. a config indirectly or
 * directly includes itself).
 *
 * @param configIncludes  Record where each key maps to an array of included keys
 * @returns  `true` if any cycle exists, `false` otherwise
