Your team is working on an application that deals extensively with social networks. Users of the application
are presented with various insights and analytics of their own network. One of the interesting features
of the application is analyzing how close the sub networks within a user's wider social network are.

In the feature, a user's network is represented as a graph of connections, where nodes represent individual
people and edges between nodes indicate the connection between two people. The task is to check whether a
specific condition is met for any subgraph in the network: 'Every individual in the subgraph is connected
with every other person directly or indirectly.' 

To facilitate the new feature, your task is to implement a function `doesConditionExist()` that takes in the
number of total nodes in the graph (n), and an array of edges where each edge is represented as a pair of
nodes it connects. The function should return true if the condition is met for any subgraph, or false if not.

Assume nodes are numbered from 1 to n.
